## FAQ
**How is this different from node-red-contrib-sonos?**

Our set of Sonos nodes are less error-prone and much easier to work with
 *  config-node comes with a simple selection rather than entering IP Address manually
 *  Sonos devices are identified by their serial number, not dynamic IP address
 *  1 single node to report all current status of device
 *  Better documentation
 *  It is maintained by a team of experienced developers & hackers
 *  More convenient nodes are in development
